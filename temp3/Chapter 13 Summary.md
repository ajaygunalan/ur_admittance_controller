### **Key Points**
- Use **types** (units, ADTs) to move bugs to **compile time**.
- Pure functions make **unit tests** trivial and reusable across input forms.
- Prefer **generated** and **property-based** tests to cover more input space.
- **Comparative testing**: validate new implementations against known-good versions.
- With monadic dataflow, you can **toggle async off** for tests by replacing streams with ranges and using reply-capable wrappers.
