# Force/Torque Sensor Processing Update

## Changes Made

We have simplified the force/torque sensor processing in the UR Admittance Controller by removing the special case handling that was previously used when the force/torque sensor frame was identical to the base frame.

### Key Modifications

1. **Force Processing Logic**
   - **Before**: Conditionally applied transform only if `params_.ft_frame != params_.base_link`
   - **After**: Unconditionally applies force transformation if transform is valid

2. **Transform Caches**
   - **Before**: Skipped F/T transform update when sensor frame matched base frame
   - **After**: Always updates both tip and F/T transforms regardless of frame configuration

3. **Transform Validation**
   - **Before**: Special condition for when F/T frame matched base frame
   - **After**: Consistently checks F/T transform validity in all cases

4. **TF Lookup**
   - **Before**: Only checked for F/T transform if frames differed
   - **After**: Always checks for F/T transform availability

## Benefits

1. **Simplified Logic**
   - Removed special case branching, making code flow more consistent
   - Improved readability by using a unified approach

2. **Consistent Transform Management**
   - All transforms are treated equally regardless of frame configuration
   - Reduces potential for bugs due to inconsistent handling

3. **Standardized Force Processing**
   - Forces are always explicitly transformed using the adjoint matrix
   - Creates a more predictable behavior model

## Implementation Details

The simplified approach follows our updated frame notation consistently:

```cpp
// Always apply transform from F/T sensor to base frame
if (transform_base_ft_.isValid()) {
  const auto& transform_data = transform_base_ft_.getTransform();
  F_sensor_base_ = transform_data.adjoint * raw_wrench;
} else {
  // No valid transform yet - use raw data as fallback
  F_sensor_base_ = raw_wrench;
}
```

This consistent handling ensures that all spatial quantities are properly transformed between frames, maintaining our notation principle that clearly indicates what is being measured (`F`), from where (`sensor`), and in which frame it's expressed (`base`).

The controller now always treats the force/torque sensor frame as potentially different from the base frame, applying the appropriate transformation matrix in all cases. This approach is both more explicit and more robust to configuration changes.
